# HydraSynth-Projects
Things I've made with hydra synth. 

## Setup
Get Python (latest version) will do. Double click "server.py". This is how I access local files in the hydra code. 

## Running the code
Go here: https://hydra.ojack.xyz/
Copy a paste the contents of a .js file into the browser. I've starting working offline, but there is no reason why it should run in the browser (it may be a little laggy). 

Feel free to use the code however you want. I don't really care lol
